**Welcome to the File Warehouse!**               

this is a small program i coded in python

that took about 3 days to make

its an archive manager for a custom file type

that i made called Crates

i know its currently just a .zip reskin, but

once i add some of the planned features its

gonna be quite cool (i have alot of them lol)
